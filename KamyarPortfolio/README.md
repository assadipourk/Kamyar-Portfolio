# My-Professional Portfolio

## My Portfolio:

This website lays out my web application development portfolio in an easy to navigate and digestable way. 

To see the current plans for how the website will look, visit the 'WIKI' section of the repository.

(The branches have become very messy due to changing how I am approching this project. Things will be cleaned up once the project becomes more complete.)
